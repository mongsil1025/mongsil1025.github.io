## What is TSX file?

A TSX file is a TypeScript(.ts) file written using JSX syntax. It contains code that is most likely part of a single-page or mobile application.

JSX, also known as JavaScript XML, is an extension to the JavaScript programming language. Developers use JSX syntax when developing applications using React.

React developers save their in-progress JSX-laden code as TSX files, before eventually transforming those files into `.jsx(react javascript)` or `.js` files.
