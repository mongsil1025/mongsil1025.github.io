## 인프라 용어
- 프로비저닝 (provisioning) : 사용자의 요구에 맞게 시스템 자원을 할당, 배치, 배포해 두었다가 필요 시 시스템을 즉시 사용할 수 있는 상태로 준비해두는 것을 말한다 (출처: [위키](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EB%B9%84%EC%A0%80%EB%8B%9D))

## IaC를 위한 Tools

### Vagrant

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/index) is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

Remarkable is that, once someone else creates a single **vagrantfile**, we just need to `vagrant up` and everything is installed and configured for we to work. This means that other members of a team create their development environments from the same configuration.

|Command|Description|
|-----|----|
|vagrant init|Make base `VagrantFile` for provisioning|
|vagrant up|Read Vagrantfile and run provisioning|
|vagrant halt|Exit virtual machine running at vagrant|
|vagrant destroy|Destroy virtual machine running at vagrant|
|vagrant ssh|Access to virtual machine running at vagrant|
|vagrant provision|Apply changes to virtual machine running at vagrant|

### VirtualBox

[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. You have experienced at your school (if your are in computer engineering major) that run Window OS on MAC. Virtual Box helps running other OS on the machine even if the OS does not match for it
